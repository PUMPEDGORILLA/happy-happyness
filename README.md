PUMPEDGORILLA is a  non-profit animal rescue organization . We rescue, care and feed dogs, cats and other types of animals suffering on the streets or neglected in the wild. Through rescue and education, PUMPEDGORILLA works to raise awareness for abandoned animals. We rescues animals in the middle-european area / Austria and Hungary / and beyond in an effort to end animal neglect, homelessness and abuse.  The team rescues animals, provides veterinary care, and transfers the animals to partner adoption centers. After the rescues, the team creates videos which they share on YouTube and Facebook to educate the public on the importance of companion animals in our society and inspire people to take action, support the cause, adopt animals, and help reduce euthanasia rates at shelters across the country. PMPD is our cryptocurrency token what we use for charity.
